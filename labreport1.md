## cd command
![cd](cd.png)

1. **No Argument:** The working directory when running the cd command with no argument is in /home/lecture1. When the cd command is entered with no arguments, the user is returned to the home directory. There were no errors when running this command.
2. **Directory as Argument:** The working directory when running the cd command with a directory as an argument was /home. In this case since "lecture1" was passed in as the argument, the user's working directory was changed back to /home/lecture1. This might be because the cd command changes the user's directory into the name of the directory that is passed in as an argument when running the command. There were no errors when running this command. 
3. **File as Argument:** The working directory when running the cd command with a file as an argument was /home/lecture1. When passing in "Hello.java" as an arguemnt, the terminal returned an error indicating that "Hello.java" was not a directory. This might be because the cd command can only be used with directories as an argument and not with files.
